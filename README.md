# WebSocket Project README

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of WebSockets for real-time communication between a client and a server. WebSockets allow for bi-directional communication over a single, long-lived connection, providing a more interactive and efficient way to exchange data.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the WebSocket project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **NPM** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GabrielNeves24/websocker_server_dad_202324.git
cd your-websocket-repo
npm install

### Running the Server
To start the WebSocket server, use the following command:
```bash
npm start

The server should now be running on localhost:3000 (or your specified port). You can configure the port and other settings in the project's configuration files.
